# Flock Guard

Introducing Flock Guard, a cutting-edge poultry monitoring system that leverages deep learning and computer vision to revolutionize poultry health management. Utilizing YOLO v8, this advanced model predicts and monitors the health of poultry in real-time, providing immediate health alerts and integrating real-time climate monitoring to ensure optimal living conditions and enhance poultry welfare. This project aims to automate health monitoring, reduce manual oversight, and promote sustainable farming practices. A comprehensive research paper detailing the methodologies and findings is forthcoming.
